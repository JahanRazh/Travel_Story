### Project Description: Travel Story Platform using MERN Stack (React + Vite, TailwindCSS, JWT, Postman, VS Code)

#### Overview:
The **Travel Story Platform** is a web application designed for travelers to document, share, and relive their travel memories.

The application is styled using **TailwindCSS** for a modern and responsive design, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** is used for secure user authentication. The development process is streamlined using **VS Code** and API testing is done via **Postman**.
